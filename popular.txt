Down Sunset
In every place
In every face
Yeah, uh, uh
Yeah, uh, uh
Tell me, do you see her? She's livin' her life
Even if she acts like she don't want the limelight
But if you knew her, yeah, she lives a lie
She calls the paparazzi, then she acts surprised, oh
Oh, I know what she needs (oh-oh)
She just want the fame, I know what she fiends (oh-oh)
Give her a little taste, runnin' back to me (oh-oh)
Put it in her veins, pray her soul to keep, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, every night (every night)
She prays to the sky
Flashin' lights
Is all she ever wanted
Beggin' on her knees to be popular
That's her dream, to be popular (huh)
Kill anyone to be popular
Sell her soul to be popular (popular)
Just to be popular (uh-huh)
Everybody scream 'cause she popular (huh)
She mainstream 'cause she popular
Never be free 'cause she popular
Money on top of me, money on top of her (uh-huh)
Money on top of me, money on top of her (uh-huh)
Yeah, shawty fuck with me 'cause she know I'm popular (uh-huh)
Yeah, shawty fuck with me 'cause she know I'm popular
I know that you see me (huh), time's gone by
Spend my whole life runnin' from your flashin' lights
Try to own it, but I'm alright (alright)
You can't take my soul without a fuckin' fight, oh
Oh, I know what she needs (oh-oh)
She just want the fame, I know what she fiends (oh-oh)
Give her a little taste, runnin' back to me (oh-oh)
Put it in her veins, pray her soul to keep, ooh-ooh (uh)
Ooh-ooh, every night (every night)
She prays to the sky (huh)
Flashin' lights
Is all she ever wanted
Beggin' on her knees to be popular (huh)
That's her dream, to be popular (huh)
Kill anyone to be popular
Sell her soul to be popular (popular)
Just to be popular (uh-huh)
Everybody scream 'cause she popular (huh)
She mainstream 'cause she popular
Never be free 'cause she popular
Money on top of me, money on top of her (uh-huh)
Money on top of me, money on top of her (uh-huh)

Pop-popular, born to be popular
She in debt, 20 mill, but she run it up

Beggin' on her knees to be popular
That's her dream, to be popular (huh)
Kill anyone to be popular
Sell her soul to be popular (popular)
Just to be popular (uh-huh)
Everybody scream 'cause she popular (huh)

(Ayy)

I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli' point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, ah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch outta your league too, ah

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Look what you've done
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Look what you've done
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy

Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Comin' for the king, that's a far cry, I
I come alive in the fall time, I
The competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne, bumpin' New Edition

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall, took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new Wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop lookin' lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
