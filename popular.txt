Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no force for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be
Tell nobody I control you
I broke you just to own you
They can't tell that I love you
'Cause you're loyal, baby
I love when you're submissive
Love it when I break skin
You feel pain without flinchin'
So say it
Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down
My kinda love
Push me and choke me 'til I pass out
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls
Tonight (tonight)
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls
Tonight (tonight), oh
Push me down, hold me down
Spit in my mouth while you turn me on
I wanna take your light inside
Dim me down, snuff me out
Hands on my neck while you push it out
And I'm screamin' out
Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down
My kinda love
Force me and choke me 'til I pass out
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls
Tonight (tonight)
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no (oh)
I just wanna be one of your girls
Tonight, oh
Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no force for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be
Top of the world but I'm still not free
It's such a secret that I keep
Until it's gone, I can never find peace
Brace my whole life just to be
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls
Tonight (tonight)
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no (oh)
I just wann–∞ be one of your girls
Tonight (ooh), oh

(Ayy)

I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli' point two just to hurt you, ah
All red Lamb just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, ah
Main bitch outta your league too, ah
Side bitch outta your league too, ah

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid
You talkin' 'bout me, I don't see the shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain

(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Look what you've done

Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Comin' for the king, that's a far cry, I
I come alive in the fall time, I
The competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne, bumpin' New Edition

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face, man, I love my baby, ah
You talkin' money, need a hearin' aid

Let a nigga brag Pitt
Legend of the fall, took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new Wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop lookin' lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
A hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table, cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
